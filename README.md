This package contains selected methods that:
- offer Python implementation of the iterative sampling method mc-intersite-proj-th (MIPT) proposed in 
  K Crombecq, E Laermans, T Dhaene,
  *Efficient space-filling and non-collapsing sequential design strategies for simulation-based modeling*,
  Eur J Oper Res 214 (2011), 683-696,
- simplify training of XGBoost and ANN surrogate models with *k*-fold cross validation for a given pandas dataframe, and
- produce visually appealing 3D diagrams for selected columns using vedo.

Package is developed for work on (and described in) the paper
> S Stevanović, H Dashti, M Milošević, S Al-Yakoob, D Stevanović, 
> *Comparison of ANN and XGBoost surrogate models trained on small numbers of building energy simulations*,
> PLoS ONE 19 (2024) e0312573.

It can be installed also by `pip install overhang_surrogates`.
